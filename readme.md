I'm sure the question everyone is thinking is "why." Why make a programming language entirely. Why go out of my way to implement a formal grammar with a parser for a meme?

The simple answer, of course, is because I hate myself.

 The more accurate answer is because I wanted to flex my superior python Coding skills, by creating things more slower than Python, and i wanted to try out writing a basic interpreter and grammar, in preparation for possibly writing an LLVM compiler for a few esoteric programming languages in the near future..
